# FTC 2019-2020
Code for the FTC team 14891 in the 2019-2020 school year

### Deploy to robot from Android Studio
~~[Wireless deploy from Android Studio](https://blog.jcole.us/2017/04/13/wireless-programming-for-ftc-robots/#add-several-useful-external-tools)~~

These wireless deploy gradle settings do work: [https://github.com/clwillingham/skystone_onbot_hybrid](https://github.com/clwillingham/skystone_onbot_hybrid)

Basically I downloaded the source and pasted _gradlew.bat_ (or if you're on mac/linux _gradlew_), _build.gradle_, _build.common.gradle_, and _settings.gradle_ into the skystone folder.
